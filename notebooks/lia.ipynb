Unfortunately, you need a lot of hair to be able to use these for the hairstyles they show.  I find they are a little difficult to get them aligned right to stay securely in my finer hair.  I'm also a little concerned that they may be too tight fitting on my hair and may cause some hair damage.  I've only used a couple times and stopped using because of this.\"\n",

Excellent for use in the bathtub, or for a mini nap, or simply to help relaxation. Might even be perfect post skin treatment sessions that may leave skin feeling irritated.<br /><br />Stocking stuffer!! I love how budget friendly this pack is. I love making little self-care packages to hand out, and while I will buy and use masks in the $5-35 range, I prefer the $1-3 masks for the token give away (think: facial mask, hand cream, lip balm, etc.. tiny cheap self care packages). I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to. The more basic masks tend to be good for nearly everyone, and the resulting feeling is at least a fresh, hydrated face. So these are a repurchase for that purpose, as well as for my own use on days I want to keep it simple.<br /><br />I love that it has lots of moisture. The serum can be patted in all over face, neck, chest, even elbows & hands after.<br /><br />For all that it is, I give it 5 stars for this level of facial mask.'\n",

Deep, electric, and long lasting.<br />• Sonic Green: more blue-based than I originally realized, I loved the green-teal color. Perfect mix of green with a bit of blue and fades almost minty. It covered over orange bleached hair well.<br />• Blue Velvet: a gorgeous deep denim blue that starts out deceptively dark and begins to lighten after a few washes. Easily applied over orangey bleached hair.<br /><br />These are direct, veggie-based dyes, so it does NO harm to leave in your hair long. The longer you leave it in, the more difficult it may be to remove later when you want to change colors, but it'll also ensure you don't need to touch it up for awhile.

      " \"If you're looking for an effective and affordable way to remove unwanted hair at home, the Batiki hair removal wax roller kit is worth considering. This kit is easy to use and comes with everything you need to achieve smooth and soft skin for many weeks. One of the best features of this kit is its double-sided heating panels, which ensure a quick and even heat up of the wax. This means you'll spend less time waiting for the wax to heat up and more time enjoying silky smooth skin. Additionally, the natural ingredients in the wax, including Aloe Vera and Vitamin E, help to prevent rashes and soothe the skin, making it perfect for sensitive skin types (especially mine). Another great feature of this kit is its water-soluble wax. This means you won't have to deal with sticky residue after waxing and can easily rinse off any leftover wax with water. Plus, the kit comes with 100 wax strips, which are strong and soft for effective hair removal. I use it mostly for my legs. And with its compact and portable design, you can take it with you wherever you go. The kit also includes a carry bag for easy storage and transport. The instructions included in the kit are easy to follow, making it simple for beginners to use. Plus, the roll on waxing device works with most wax cartridges, giving you more flexibility and options. Overall, I’m very pleased with this kit and is an excellent choice for those looking for a convenient and affordable way to achieve smooth and soft skin at home.\"\n",

It has a nice gradual, natural look.  In fact, I might claim it's somewhere between ombre and sombre design.  The wig also has highlights that adds more realism and visual appeal.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a close up of the synthetic hair to note the quality and color.<br />Amazingly, the current cost is just $11.50, including the 50% discount coupon.  We felt it was worth the original $23, but the half price makes this an exceptional deal.<br />Based on the quality, visual appeal and outstanding price point, this wig easily earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating.

Before getting the straightening brush, it took me a good 15-20 minutes using a large barrel curling iron to soften my curls, but with this, it’s 5-6 minutes tops. It is very simple to use- once you plug the brush in it heats right up to temperature within seconds and is ready to go. It also, this comes with a comb that can help hold the hair in place while using the brush, but I have not had any need to use it. I simply section off my hair in four large segments and run the brush through each segment 2-3 times and I am done. The brush also cools down quickly after you turn it off, which is great for traveling purposes. Overall, I love the brush, and I get the results I want very quickly and require less time fixing my hair and exposing it to as much heat.

      " 'This set of scrubby brushes with silicone points is a cheap but effective way at getting your scalp clean from all the products and dead skin that build up on it every day. Compared to the similar version that has hard plastic point, this style is much kinder to your skin while working just was effectively.  The first time you use one of these to help wash your hair you will notice a difference in how much cleaner your scalp and hair feels.  These little scrubbies are also fanatics for giving pets a bath because the points get down through their fur and help get their skin clean. They also help do a better job than just spraying water to get all the product out of your pet\\'s fur while rinsing them off. I highly recommend using a hair catcher for your tub drain as these will also help your pet shedding process.<br /><br />Besides washing hair, these also work well for head massages if you have a headache (help increase blood flow), massaging in and distributing any serums/oils/tinctures you may be applying to your scalp to heal with hair growth, relaxing and gentle back massage (us lotion or oil so the points move easily across skin), grooming your cat or dog, or giving a gentle hip and leg massage to your pup if they are older and have arthritis. Heck, you can even use one for planting seeds - gently pack the dirt a little, level it flat, then use one of these to create perfect holes to place seeds in.  Kids can also use these to paint - dip in washable paint and make giant spirographs.  Oooh, they also work to gently itch things like hives or an allergic rash when you can\\'t use something sharp like fingernails, and these can be easily disinfected.<br /><br />The included shower cap is okay. The outside is a light blue satiny material with a white edging that reminds me of the old fashioned sleep caps worn a centuries ago, like the grandma in \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"  The plastic lining is too loud and crinkly to be worn while sleeping. It\\'s fine if used for a head covering while doing a deep conditioning treatment and it\\'s easy to rinse clean. If you were to turn it inside out to use to keep your hair from getting wet, it would work fine for a bath but not for a shower. The white edging material is fabric and is on both sides of the cap, so that at least would get wet and possibly allow water to soak up through the rest of the fabric. Still, it\\'s a nice little freebie that the seller includes.'\n",

I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a \"bird bath\" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that... I didn\\'t look.<br /><br />But for travel: definite yes. I would go so far as to use one in the shower to take care of face and entire body.

I also have the rechargeable version although I haven't checked to see if the case that came with that will work with this unit.<br /><br />The replacement brush heads for the rechargeable unit work interchangeably with this one so that's a bonus.  I did take note of what other reviewers said about the battery compartment allowing water to leak in so each time I change batteries I take a cheap lip balm and rub it over the rubber o-ring for a better seal.<br /><br />In my experience a fresh set of alkalines last well over two months with daily use.

It is thick and emollient and has a somewhat greasy residue but it is slowly absorbed into your skin. It lasts a long time.

Well, here\\'s the facts.<br /><br />1) I met the devil in this device.....I\\'m not sure whether to compare the pain to the most sensitive/worst tattoo of my life, or a dilation-8-pre-childbirth. To sum it up, it HURTS. I did both my underarms and my upper lip. The upper lip hurt the worst, hands-down. The under-arms were maybe dilation 5. You know, you\\'re starting to feel it good and are at the point of whimpering because you just can\\'t hold it in anymore....yeah, that. I will admit the 2nd time using the product was a little better. But barely. This is my first epilator. It won\\'t be my last. Despite the pain, I\\'m a lifer. I like NOT having to shave for a good 3 weeks.<br /><br />2) The charging is just \"okay\". I made it through a complete round (1st time), and into one underarm weeks later. I was almost finished with the first when it died. I had to wait until the next day to finish. That was a bit irritating but given the price, it\\'s to be expected.<br /><br />3) Perfect size. I have small hands so I really wasn\\'t wanting some bulky device that weighed a ton. This is small and light. Big plus!<br /><br />Overall, for the price and outcome, it was WELL worth it. I almost bought a $200 device but decided I\\'d test the waters with what an epilator was to begin with. Don\\'t waste your money unless you\\'re wanting to do your legs or a bigger project. This baby works great! Not great on the legs though. I tried it. I\\'ll stick to shaving those.'\n",

      " 'For 340 years, men have used the straight razor as a principal means of manual shaving. I’ve used one for 14 years employing replaceable blades but remember the feeling of a barber shave with a permanent blade straight razor that had been properly stropped; the kind of blade used since 1680 to separate a man from his facial hair.  I’ve yearned for the vintage experience of stropping my own stainless steel blade and applying metal to beard.  Today, I received this handmade straight razor, stropped it just a bit, and had a longed for experience of truly vintage shaving that left my face smooth as a river rock.  I’m elated!  So many reviews are written by folks with redwood sized chips on their shoulders. I ignored them and ordered this razor anyway. I could not be more pleased with this purchase. It was shave ready.  My stropping exercise was more just to have the full experience.  One review said there was no room for his finger between the handle and blade. I have large hands and, when the razor is held correctly, there is ample room for my finger. The weight and balance is excellent and it is simple to stabilize it for a close yet lacerationless shave.  This razor gets five stars across the board with the exception of the ‘for beginners’ category.  HELLOOO!  STRAIGHT RAZOR!!!  This is a serious piece of sharpened 440 stainless steel!  The only good straight razor for beginners is made of rubber!! If you’re ready for a vintage shaving experience at a great price, you’ve arrived!'\n",

I am a small person so my features are small, so I did have to custom fit my lashes as well as trim them which did take time to do but thats perfect because they are completely custom for me so honestally for anyone who struggles to find lashes that \"fit\" properly and look professional just buy these and spend the time to make them custom fit insted of getting ruined like some do when you cut size and trim length they became perfect! They are super easy to trim, style ect so I HIGHLY recommend doing it. I don\\'t even want to touch my other lashes now that I have these. I ware lashes every day all day.

My bestie is a makeup artist and for years she's been trying to get me to wear more and more makeup, but I simply cannot.  A few years ago, she got me onto these lashes at Naimie's [Flutter Lashes Irresistible 3 Pack for $10], so every few weeks I was there buying boxes and boxes, and then this pandemic happened and everything was closed.  I was still working but now that eye makeup is a MUST I couldn't leave my house without it.  Anyway, these are JUST LIKE the Flutter Irresistible lashes, and quite possibly a little better.  Not made quite as good quality, but still a VERY decent value for 9 pairs versus the 3 pairs I was paying.  I will 100% be buying these again.\"\n",

I squeeze about two pumps worth onto my hands and apply it all over my face. I concentrate on areas that need filling in, like around my eyes and mouth where I have fine lines. Then let it settle for about 5 minutes and apply my normal makeup routine. My foundation glides right over it and doesn't settle in to any of my fine lines or wrinkles.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid choice for a good primer.

      " 'As a die hard Final Fantasy fan and collector, I was excited to get this set.  I believe this is/was for retailers. The box looks like it can be manipulated to create an open display where the blind boxes can be purchased separately.  I think this is super cool.  The box is black, labeled Dissidia Trading Arts vol. 2 set and has pictures of all five figures.<br /><br /> Inside the outer box are six blind boxes (even though there are only five figures).  For those of you who may not know what a blind box is, it\\'s a box where you can\\'t tell what\\'s inside.  The UPC and artwork are the same on each box.  That\\'s why you can\\'t be assured of getting all five figures.  If you get duplicates, you\\'re encouraged to trade them with friends (hence the Trading Arts).  I opened five boxes and got all five characters, so I\\'m going to leave the sixth box unopened.  I\\'ll display it with the figures because the artwork is cool.  I\\'ll try to upload pictures of the boxes.<br /><br />There is some assembly required, but not too much.  Mostly connecting the upper torso to the legs and connecting weapons.  I had a tough time assembling them because their pieces fit so tightly together.  I had to get my husband to help with two of them.  Finding a safe area to grip was part of it.  You\\'ll want to be careful around Firion\\'s ponytail and the hilts of their swords.  They can be snapped off with little effort.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that Terra/Tina is difficult to put and keep on her stand, but I\\'ve got a solution.  Any doll stand that fits around her waist will solve that problem.  Tina is about 5\" tall, so I\\'m going to get a mini doll stand where the waist gripper is 2.5\" high. (I had to do the same thing for the Warrior of Light.)<br /><br />It takes a while to get them put together. Seriously, Firion has like five weapons you need to attach and Cecil has one that attaches to his lower back.  You have to keep it from falling off as you squeeze it under his cape, but once assembled, they are something to look at.  These are actual Square Enix figures (not knock offs) and they look it.  The detail in their hair and clothing is amazing!  My favorites are Cecil and of course, Sephiroth. Be mindful of his Masamune katana, it\\'s accidentally knocked a couple of my other figures over.<br /><br />Overall, this set is an awesome deal.  If you bought all the figures separately, not only would the boxes be opened (necessary to find out who was inside) you\\'d spend over $200.  Sephiroth is around $60 by himself.  Terra/Tina is more than that and not only would you not have Bartz/Butz (I couldn\\'t find him separately), you wouldn\\'t get the sixth blind box either. I highly recommend this set to any Final Fantasy fan.'\n",

The clamp-style makes it easy to hold and style - just clamp the end of your hair and wind the strand around.  I like a 1-inch barrel like this one has, you can create tighter spiral-y curls or you can wind the strands looser and create less defined waves.  It was a nice bonus that this curling iron came with a carrying bag, two styling clips, a glove to protect your hand from heat, and a comb.  The iron itself looks attractive and stylish with the rose gold color.<br /><br />I have used this curling iron to create both a tousled, bed-head wavy look with volume, and to create more tight curls that I arranged into an updo for attending a wedding.

The size is really good, plenty of room on the table top and leg room is ample. The table does not rock, but sits firmly, proving it was built square.  The built in vent is very helpful.  When my wife and sister do each others nails they would often joke that they were going to die from all the nail dust....well this vent will now prevent an early death!<br /><br />The desk itself has two outer drawers that slide out.  The one in the middle tilts out and is simply an access cubby to turn the vent switch on and off.<br /><br />The critiques I have are minor.  1) The glass top didn't fit the table top exactly...it was off by a little, maybe 1/8&#34;.  I flipped it over to see if it fit better and it was still off.  The vent still fit in the hole ok.  2) There is no 1 1/2&#34; hole inside the middle cubby to allow the electrical cord to go through so you can plug it in to an outlet.  I'll have to drill that myself.  I'm also going to do some other &#34;convenience&#34; modifications which involve installing more outlets near the bottoms of the legs so there won't be cords draped all around for the lamp, UV, Dremel, and fan.  There will essentially be one cord providing power to the table, and then the other accessories will plug into the table.<br /><br />Overall, I give it a 4 1/2 stars rating.  If the glass fit better and the middle cubby had an access hole for the fan cord, that would make it a 5 star.  I can't choose 4 1/2 so i'll mark it a 5.  It's more 5 than 4 anyways.<br /><br />I guess I could talk about the money a bit.  Yes, this was expensive.  $400 plus $150 s/h plus $65 to deliver to a residential address (which I didn't know about.  To the manufacturer: you should disclose this additional cost upfront).  No matter what table I looked at, they all were going to have a high shipping cost.  So then it was a matter of choosing between a $200 table and $400 and up because for some reason these manicure tables are expensive, even the cheap plywood models on wheels.  So I opted to pay more for quality.  It seems like it will last as long as we need it, and it matches the decor of the room.<br /><br />I attached a picture for size comparison.

He says it gives him a much closer shave (probably due to the fact that there's an actual razor blade inside the shaver) and that, while it's a little weird shaving with just the edge of a razor (instead of having those disposable heads against his cheek) he's starting to prefer it because of the results he's getting.<br /><br />And it's really easy to clean! You simply turn a knob in the handle and the shaver opens and you can take out the blade inside and give it a little rinse and you're done!  My husband applies a little oil to make it go further but it's a less than 30 second job and he sets it to dry to be ready for the next use.<br /><br />After his experience, I really recommend this shaver to anyone else in the market who may have the same experience as him! My husband is a very hard man to impress and the fact that this has immediately become his new favorite razor says a lot to me and I hope it does to you as well.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.

      " \"I have been looking for a dark, truly green hair dye for ages. Most dark greens skew hard teal,and mixing colors to get the desired shade usually fades to blue annoyingly fast. Green Tomato is the color of tomato vines and is very pigmented—it's such a dark green that it looks almost black when it comes out of the tube. It has a gray undertone rather than a blue or yellow one. I love this color. It's a muted, deep green that fades to a dark mossy tone after many washes. The result is a more natural, &#34;lived-in&#34; color right from the start.<br /><br />The dye has a gel-like consistency that makes it very spreadable. I have shoulder-length, fine hair. Even using this completely undiluted and unmixed, I will get at least a dozen uses out of this one tube. I've used it undiluted to achieve a dark green that passes for black in dim or soft lighting. (Side Note: be careful to avoid applying undiluted dye directly to your scalp, this stains your skin quite badly.) I've diluted it with white, silicone-free conditioner to create a pastel version. Using a lot of conditioner creates a slightly grainy mixture, but it hasn't affected the quality or longevity of the results. I've also mixed it with several other brands of dye (e.g. Pravana, Iroiro, La Riche Directions, and Bigen Vivid Shades) with no issues and positive results. It smells sort of like markers, with a hint of perfume. It's not particularly terrible, but it's one of the worst-smelling brands of semi-permanent hair color I've come across.<br /><br />I really think Sarangsae is doing something special with the shade range they offer. I've used over a dozen brands in all the colors of the rainbow, but nobody else is creating such soft, understated colors. It's not too hard for me to achieve a soft pastel (either by using a pastel dye or diluting a dark dye) but dark shades are usually extremely bright. I love mixing my own colors, and the hardest thing to achieve is a muted dark hue. I've added silver dyes,the Pravana Vivids &#34;black&#34; additive, and/or small amounts of opposing shades (i.e., a dab of pink or light orange to a green to tone it down) with various success. I'm really excited to try some of their other muted colors in the future, like Black Rose, Deep Grey, or Mustard Yellow. If they can make a truly soft, deep, dark green, they can probably make any shade!\"\n",

I have used this Aloe for the past year and I was going to reorder it again for the forth time, when I noticed the lack of good reviews for the product, this made me feel bad because I just love it. First time I bought it because I had some irritation around my eyes and I wanted to buy something without alcohol so it does not get irritated more. I started using it around the eyes then my whole face. I love how my skin looks in the morning, very clear  and glowing. I had some sun damage on my forehead and all of a sudden it started fading then it disappeared completely. I started putting it on my forearms and hands and it also helped with the sun damage that you get on the arms from driving. Now I use it on my chest, full face and forearms and my skin looks amazing. I only put it at night in place of a night cream, it is a little sticky for a minute but it is absorbed very quickly. By the time I finish putting it on my face it has already dried on my chest and forearms. You have to be persistent and apply it every night and you have to be patient. It seems that the time it takes to fade the discoloration has to do with how bad the skin is damaged. I had areas that cleared faster then others. Also it seems that some areas might look worse before they get better. It will look darker then as if a little more visible before it completely disappear. I have sent this to my sister overseas and she also loves it. You do not need to use a lot, it spreads very nicely. I recommend this product for anyone who has sun damage and discoloration on the skin, just be patient and consistent.'\n",

The silk top on this is GORGEOUS!! The color is just right. The construction is good too, it doesn't add bulk to the wig.<br />The hair itself is SO soft. It's perfect.

My first was also from Amazon, but it had a middle part and was completely straight and very long. It looked pretty, but it wasn't right for me, and tangled so so much. I realized I needed something closer to my preferred look when I have long hair, with a side part (I buzzed my real hair recently to remove bleach-damaged hair and a cut I didn't like).<br /><br />PROS: This has the perfect round-brush blowout look, and the hair itself is a mix of dark purple and dark brown, very cool and subtle. The layering is PERFECT, and the hairs are soft but realistic, with a slight kink that keeps it from looking too fake (although I still chose to mist it with some dry shampoo to tone down the shine a bit). Most importantly it DOES NOT TANGLE. All the wigs I have tangle SO much and its the one thing I can not stand about wigs. It also fits my head really well. I have a big head and usually have to do some fiddling with wig caps and lace to get it to fit right and not squeeze my head too much, but I practically just popped this on and was good to go, no glue/tape needed!<br /><br />CON:  It sheds. I cut it a little around the hairline to make the all-important baby hairs, and later when I brushed it I thought I was just brushing out the long hairs I had cut, but the more I brushed it the more I saw hairs were falling out around the whole wig. This doesn't bother me too much, as long as not too much comes out. Overall, I love this wig and I intend to buy it again in other colors.<br /><br />EDIT: I took this on vacation soon after receiving it.

I almost got just the tin with the sponge before for the same price but this set also included a brush (great for packing shadow on the lid or running color along the lower lash line) and a brush cleaner mat with it is amazing (you can hold it while swirling wet brushes on it or suction it to the sink while cleaning).

The problem is I'm super sensitive to most products and facials can be super rough.  The leather layer has peeled off.  They suggested using just once a week since I've very sensitive skin.  I'm on week two and need to catch up prior to the wedding, so I'll need to back down from twice a week.<br /><br />I've had a another brand in the past that dried up goopy... I think it's important to keep the inner seal and not to try to stretch it out... all the opening and closing lets air in. Also, starring in an appropriate cooler area.<br /><br />Take note as with most facials your acne is going to come up, so don't wait the week before a special event.  Really give it a couple or few months to get all the gunk out of your pores.

Ok, I have to admit, we do look crazy sitting there with foil on all 10 of our fingers, these plastic nail clips make you look less crazy but the concept is even better than the foil, now I can carry these in my bag on the way to the shop and ask them to just apply the cotton soaked in acetone on top of my nails then clip these on my fingers so the cotton can stay in place. Since minimal air is traveling into these clips, the process of the polish coming off is pretty quick! cuts the soaking time in half, I just tried it yesterday and I will be ordering more for future uses and gifts to my gel nails addicted girlfriends!

It gets the job done with ease due to the fact that I have very course thick hair. You might not be impressed with the build of the clippers especially the trimmer. Basically a plastic cheap material and the trimmer feels even more cheap and runs on a AA battery. I haven't tried the trimmer though I imagine it works fine it just doesn't have a lot of real estate to work with, I'd say it's mainly for touching up a mustache or outlining around your lips. The clippers have a powerful motor. I've been using Conair products for years and this is probably one of my favorites besides the beard trimmer I've owned for years. There isn't a dial on the left side to adjust the clippers for fading but on the right side is an adjustment for setting them to full power. I was able to use a set of combs from another Conair clipper that I have that doesn't work so I didn't have to open the new ones that came with this clipper. The clipper feels very light in my hands and comfortable to use. It didn't heat up too fast and when it did it cooled pretty quickly. Overall if you're looking to save a few dollars on the price tag get it at Walgreens. And if you just want knock a lot of hair with ease then this clipper will get the job done and I imagine for pets too with the added combs.\"\n",

My current razor, a Remington non-rotary has seen better days so I decided to get a new one and tried this Norelco rotary. Big mistake (I should have learned from my last Norelco rotary shaver experience!). I have a tough beard but VERY sensitive skin. I could not get a close shave with this shaver.

      " 'For 340 years, men have used the straight razor as a principal means of manual shaving. I’ve used one for 14 years employing replaceable blades but remember the feeling of a barber shave with a permanent blade straight razor that had been properly stropped; the kind of blade used since 1680 to separate a man from his facial hair.  I’ve yearned for the vintage experience of stropping my own stainless steel blade and applying metal to beard.  Today, I received this handmade straight razor, stropped it just a bit, and had a longed for experience of truly vintage shaving that left my face smooth as a river rock.  I’m elated!  So many reviews are written by folks with redwood sized chips on their shoulders. I ignored them and ordered this razor anyway. I could not be more pleased with this purchase. It was shave ready.  My stropping exercise was more just to have the full experience.  One review said there was no room for his finger between the handle and blade. I have large hands and, when the razor is held correctly, there is ample room for my finger. The weight and balance is excellent and it is simple to stabilize it for a close yet lacerationless shave.  This razor gets five stars across the board with the exception of the ‘for beginners’ category.  HELLOOO!  STRAIGHT RAZOR!!!  This is a serious piece of sharpened 440 stainless steel!  The only good straight razor for beginners is made of rubber!! If you’re ready for a vintage shaving experience at a great price, you’ve arrived!'\n",

I used to always have soap left in my brush, but the refining section ensures that there is no soap left after a few seconds of scrubbing. I like how my brushes just stand up to dry after I’m finished with washing, and it is space saving. Like others have mentioned, it does take a few tries to load the brushes in there correctly and they will fall out a few times. One downfall with this product is the fact that the smaller brushes in the middle never really dry properly. I washed my brushes 3 days ago, had the product with my brushes sitting on a dish drying mat, and most of the brushes inside the small brush holding part are still quite wet. Some larger brushes will not fit in this product. Also DO NOT wash your beauty blender on this. This product rips up my beauty blender so that there are chunks of foam missing. I don’t regret my purchase, in fact I am quite happy that it dries my larger brushes effectively and thoroughly helps to wash my makeup brushes. If you’re thinking about it, buy it.

After nearly a year of use, the blades have stayed sharp and haven't pulled.<br /><br />On a whim, I used it to trim my brother's hair. Mind you, I'm no professional stylist, but I thought it was tremendously helpful! I cut the bulk of his hair with our Oster clippers, but I thought the Norelco was much easier to handle for detail work (i.e. shaping, sideburns, back of the neck).

I thought it was gimmicky, but I am happy to be proven wrong.<br />This is so much easier to use than a flat iron.<br />I like that it has a digital LCD that shows you what temperature the brush is heating up to.  It gives the heat range that your hair styling should be at depending on thickness, etc. I set mine to 230, the hottest setting and it worked great for my thick, curly hair.<br />It heats up very quickly and the hand grip is comfortable. The cord rotates from the end and the grip on the back of the wand feels nice in the hand.<br />The rubbery nubs on the ends of the bristles offer some flexibility, but they are not as flexible as your hairbrush. They are also shorter, too.<br />The way that you do this is to start with clean, well brushed hair.  As the bristles are short, they will not detangle for you.  Have your hair prepped and ready.  If you use a smoothing serum, it would be perfect to add it before you start with this.<br />You simply brush it over your hair like you would a hairbrush. You can brush from underneath or on top to make sure that all the hair gets close to the heated plate of the brush.<br />You can spend more time on areas that you want straightened more but I found that my doing my hair in pieces (held up with an alligator clip) worked best for me.<br />In order to get to the roots at the scalp, it was very easy.  The brush is easy to angle towards the scalp and it gets about 1/2&#34; away from the scalp easily and starts straightening from there.<br />If you hair is damp, you will see some steam, but you'd expect that with a curling iron or flatiron, too.<br />This actually worked so well, my kids wanted to try it out and they loved it!<br />The only concern that I had was that if you hair is the type to come out when you brush it, it will come out when you use this, too.  The issue was removing the hair from the straightener.  It is HOT. I had to work quickly to sweep the excess hair from the brush to toss.  I will keep a wide tooth comb by this the next time I use it so I can run it over the bristles and remove the hair.<br />All in all: I give this a strong thumbs up!<br />I can't speak about the others on the market, but this one really does what it says it will do.  It is way better than a flat iron.  It covers more ground and feels more comfortable in the hand.  Its a natural movement to brush your hair and this is no different.<br />Excellent new beauty tool!  Very happy that this does what it claims to do!

      " 'This set of scrubby brushes with silicone points is a cheap but effective way at getting your scalp clean from all the products and dead skin that build up on it every day. Compared to the similar version that has hard plastic point, this style is much kinder to your skin while working just was effectively.  The first time you use one of these to help wash your hair you will notice a difference in how much cleaner your scalp and hair feels.  These little scrubbies are also fanatics for giving pets a bath because the points get down through their fur and help get their skin clean. They also help do a better job than just spraying water to get all the product out of your pet\\'s fur while rinsing them off. I highly recommend using a hair catcher for your tub drain as these will also help your pet shedding process.<br /><br />Besides washing hair, these also work well for head massages if you have a headache (help increase blood flow), massaging in and distributing any serums/oils/tinctures you may be applying to your scalp to heal with hair growth, relaxing and gentle back massage (us lotion or oil so the points move easily across skin), grooming your cat or dog, or giving a gentle hip and leg massage to your pup if they are older and have arthritis. Heck, you can even use one for planting seeds - gently pack the dirt a little, level it flat, then use one of these to create perfect holes to place seeds in.  Kids can also use these to paint - dip in washable paint and make giant spirographs.  Oooh, they also work to gently itch things like hives or an allergic rash when you can\\'t use something sharp like fingernails, and these can be easily disinfected.<br /><br />The included shower cap is okay. The outside is a light blue satiny material with a white edging that reminds me of the old fashioned sleep caps worn a centuries ago, like the grandma in \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"  The plastic lining is too loud and crinkly to be worn while sleeping. It\\'s fine if used for a head covering while doing a deep conditioning treatment and it\\'s easy to rinse clean. If you were to turn it inside out to use to keep your hair from getting wet, it would work fine for a bath but not for a shower. The white edging material is fabric and is on both sides of the cap, so that at least would get wet and possibly allow water to soak up through the rest of the fabric. Still, it\\'s a nice little freebie that the seller includes.'\n",

      " \"My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave.

Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very.  I'm not sure if it's because of the weak motor or bad design, after 10 minutes of skin-stretching and going over the same parts of my beard, I still had plenty of whisers showing.  Very disappointed, especially for the money.  I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco.  It is going back.\"\n",

      " '\\ufeffThe Dermaclara Claritone Intensify serum micropulsation device has a slim, elegant design with a flat metal head applicator. The pulsation is gentle rather than an abrupt or annoying vibration, and I enjoy the way it feels when applying my face serum. I actually feel a slight warming sensation that I assume is due to increased blood circulation, and I have more color in my face after using this device. It’s a healthy color rather than an irritation, and I like it as my skin is pale and can look drab.<br /><br />My skin feels extra smooth and soft after using this serum micropulsation device. It seems like it aids absorption of my serums, but I can’t say for sure and it may be that I end up using more serum than usual. I typically use only a pump or two when applied with my fingers, but I probably use twice that in conjunction with this device. I really don’t know if this device can actually improve my skin tone or fine lines, but I love how my skin feels and it’s relaxing to use. It runs on a regular watch battery (included).

      " \"I was immediately enchanted with this hairpiece from the second I tried it on. I've tried wearing it a few days in a row now, and I'm not tired of it yet. First, I'll start by saying that I ordered it as an add-on item in &#34;dark blue to peacock green.&#34; With Prime, it only took two days to get to my house; very fast and convenient shipping, and the hairpiece was encased in a clear plastic bag; I threw that away, as I keep my extensions in a silk hair case. This hairpiece is actually pretty high quality for synthetic, eccentric hair, so I would suggest something like that to keep it safe and untangled when you're not wearing it.<br /><br />In my opinion, the product images do not really do this hairpiece justice. I can't say anything for other colors yet, but the dark blue to peacock green is pretty true to the product images, with sapphire blue roots and aqua-blue tips (although I will say the hairpiece I received is not half-and-half blue and green like the picture; mine is like an ombre gradient, approximately 2/3 blue and 1/3 aqua tips).<br /><br />Many of the reviews here also have mixed comments on the thickness of the hairpiece; maybe the people who say it is &#34;thin&#34; are comparing it to their own natural hair? I will say that this piece is very thick for a single-weft hair extension. A weft is like a curtain of hair with a seam holding it all together at the top. I wear extensions almost every day after a butchered haircut took 12 inches of my hair. Authentic human hair extensions come in wefts of varying widths, usually one clip wide or four clips wide, and the hair is very thin because the wefts are meant to be layered on in sections, like natural hair. This blue hair extension is 5 clips wide--wide enough to fasten on your head from ear to ear. Because of my experiences with authentic human hair extensions, I was expecting this blue piece to be thin and underwhelming, but I was wrong and am very happy about that.<br /><br />I also have an asymmetrical haircut that is close-cropped on one side, so this extension is actually too wide for me to wear across my nape (as the model does in the product image), but I am still able to use it. I curve it to clip from my left nape to above my right ear and it suits my needs and still looks real, despite its unusual color.<br /><br />Since there is so much hair on a single weft, as other reviewers have stated, this hair extension is a bit heavy. That may take some getting used to, as improper clipping could cause some discomfort and irritation from pulling on the roots. However, once you get practice putting it in, you will learn the best way to clip it without any tugging or pulling of the hair.<br /><br />It is synthetic material, and while I noticed that mine was shiny, it was not like &#34;Barbie hair,&#34; as some reviewers said. I did not need to rub any baby powder in; I just wore it to work for a few hours a day and the shine eventually dulled to look a little less like synthetic material. I will try to add some photos to this page of what the extension looks like in my (straight black) hair. I also noticed that it became easily tangled after a few days of wear. This is not really a problem; I am afraid to brush it too often though, as it sheds (which is normal, but I want it to last).<br /><br />Lastly, despite being synthetic material, I have tried straightening it on the high setting on my Conair flatiron with success. You can also use a razor or scissors to make any modifications to the style or length, if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I think you will be very satisfied with this product if you buy it. I liked it so much that I placed an order for dark pink/light pink and yellow/lime green. These were not add-on items, however, so I will be waiting until mid-August to September to receive these other hair extensions. Hopefully they will be as nice as the blue/peacock green, because I was not disappointed!\"\n",

The only downfall is that you really need to be an expert using liquid eyeliner.  I am not.  So practice makes perfect.  Every time gets better.  When applying, a magnetic 'chunk' will sometimes appear and will throw your line off.  Removal is easy, but not super quick.  Because of the strong hold, I have to gently apply/rub a makeup wipe over the lashes until the product is removed and lashes can be peeled off.  All of the different thicknesses and lengths of lashes given allows for many uses!  For the same price as drug store brands, I get so much more!!  Great purchase, just need more practice!\"\n",

My first was also from Amazon, but it had a middle part and was completely straight and very long. It looked pretty, but it wasn't right for me, and tangled so so much. I realized I needed something closer to my preferred look when I have long hair, with a side part (I buzzed my real hair recently to remove bleach-damaged hair and a cut I didn't like).<br /><br />PROS: This has the perfect round-brush blowout look, and the hair itself is a mix of dark purple and dark brown, very cool and subtle. The layering is PERFECT, and the hairs are soft but realistic, with a slight kink that keeps it from looking too fake (although I still chose to mist it with some dry shampoo to tone down the shine a bit). Most importantly it DOES NOT TANGLE. All the wigs I have tangle SO much and its the one thing I can not stand about wigs. It also fits my head really well. I have a big head and usually have to do some fiddling with wig caps and lace to get it to fit right and not squeeze my head too much, but I practically just popped this on and was good to go, no glue/tape needed!<br /><br />CON:  It sheds. I cut it a little around the hairline to make the all-important baby hairs, and later when I brushed it I thought I was just brushing out the long hairs I had cut, but the more I brushed it the more I saw hairs were falling out around the whole wig. This doesn't bother me too much, as long as not too much comes out.

So, if you're interested--here's my night routine: wash with glycolic acid orange japanese soap--leave on for 10 minutes, wash off then wash with acne wash, use rest of acne products, then use retinol on face, then use this directly on the scars.

In the few months I've owned it, I've been very pleased with the performance and the overall results.  Here are a few things I've found...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The moisturizing system does work very well.  I get substantially less skin irritation than I have in previous razors that I've used.<br />- I've discovered I enjoy shaving in the shower.  I always tried to avoid mixing shaving before a shower due to the irritation, but this works well.<br />- The charging and refill system is nice (more on this later).<br />- Comfortable to hold and use.<br />- I shave more often using this than any other razor I've used previously.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You'll be compelled to shave daily, since it works best and most efficiently that way.  That can be a pro or a con, depending on your lifestyle.<br />- While the charge and refill station is great, it seems that I always run out of moisturizer before running out of battery, so I have to remember to refill it myself, since they suggest not leaving the razor on charge all the time.<br />- I haven't found a great shower mirror yet, so I wind up starting my shave prior to the shower, to trim around sideburns and the like.<br />- Works better as a wet razor than as a dry one.<br />- While I like the scent of the moisturizer, it took me a bit to get used to it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this razor and would suggest it to anyone looking for a new electric.
